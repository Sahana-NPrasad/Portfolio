Hi, I am Sahana N Prasad
A UX Designer, crafting digital interface pixel by pixel.
With a Degree in Comupter Science and User Experience my strength lies in big picture thinking and not being lost in the data. I love people, hence I keep people at the center of all my design decisions.
I mix Technology + Emotions to turn head scraters to high-fives for real people.

I have curated a list of project I was a part of during my interships and also during my collborative work @Loughborough University.
My Projects that are live are Heartfulness and Olive Garden

Tools: Figma, Adobe XD, Framer, Miro
